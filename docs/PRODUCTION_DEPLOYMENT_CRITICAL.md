- Multi-validator network configuration
- Health checks and restart policies

### Production Checklist:

## ‚öôÔ∏è SYSTEM DEPENDENCIES & COMPATIBILITY

### Critical Requirements Discovered:
- **GLIBC Version**: Minimum 2.38 required (Ubuntu 24.04+)
- **Rust Toolchain**: Specific arkworks ZK library versions
- **libmdbx**: Version 0.6.1 with specific configuration
- **Network Ports**: 8080-8082 per validator + health check ports

### Deployment Environment:
- [ ] OS compatibility verification (Ubuntu 24.04+ or equivalent GLIBC)
- [ ] Rust toolchain standardization across environments
- [ ] Network firewall configuration
- [ ] Time synchronization (NTP) for consensus
- [ ] Hardware specifications validation

## üîß CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT

### Critical Configuration Items:
- Network topology and peer discovery
- ZK key paths and permissions

- Consensus parameters and timeouts
- Settlement thresholds and validation rules

### Production Requirements:
- [ ] Environment-specific configuration files
- [ ] Secrets management integration (Vault, K8s secrets)
- [ ] Configuration validation and testing
- [ ] Change management procedures
- [ ] Configuration backup and recovery

## üìã MANDATORY PRODUCTION TASKS

### 1. Legal & Regulatory
- [ ] Multi-party legal agreements for trusted setup
- [ ] Regulatory compliance review (GDPR, financial regulations)
- [ ] Cyber insurance coverage verification
- [ ] Data protection impact assessment

### 2. Security Auditing
- [ ] Complete security audit by certified firm

- [ ] Code review by independent security experts
- [ ] Vulnerability assessment and remediation

### 3. Operational Readiness
- [ ] 24/7 monitoring and alerting system
- [ ] Incident response procedures
- [ ] Emergency contacts and escalation
- [ ] Business continuity planning

### 4. Performance & Scalability
- [ ] Load testing with production volumes
- [ ] Network latency optimization
- [ ] Database performance tuning
- [ ] Capacity planning and scaling procedures

### 5. Key Management Infrastructure
- [ ] HSM procurement and setup
- [ ] Key ceremony coordination between SPs
- [ ] Secure key distribution mechanisms
- [ ] Key rotation and emergency procedures

## üö® CRITICAL SECURITY WARNINGS

### DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION:
- ‚ùå Demo ZK keys from `trusted-setup-demo`
- ‚ùå Development certificates or credentials
- ‚ùå Default configuration values
- ‚ùå Test network settings
- ‚ùå Docker images built on developer machines
- ‚ùå Hardcoded network topology or peer lists

### MUST IMPLEMENT:
- ‚úÖ Multi-party trusted setup ceremony
- ‚úÖ HSM-backed key storage
- ‚úÖ Independent security auditing
- ‚úÖ Regulatory compliance validation
- ‚úÖ Emergency response procedures
- ‚úÖ Secure container image pipeline
- ‚úÖ Runtime security monitoring

## üîç LESSONS LEARNED FROM IMPLEMENTATION

### Technical Discoveries:
1. **GLIBC Compatibility**: Binary compiled on newer systems won't run on older containers
2. **Network Topic Mapping**: Gossipsub topic names must match exactly between components
3. **ZK Key Dependencies**: System fails immediately without proper trusted setup
4. **Storage Integrity**: Sled vs MDBX - never use embedded databases for production data
5. **Container Persistence**: Host bind mounts required for true data persistence

### Integration Challenges:
- **libmdbx API Changes**: Version 0.6.1 has different type inference requirements
- **arkworks Dependencies**: Specific version compatibility matrix required
- **Docker Layer Caching**: Pre-built binaries significantly reduce build times
- **Network Formation**: Bootstrap node timing critical for peer discovery

### Performance Considerations:
- **Settlement Thresholds**: ‚Ç¨1 vs ‚Ç¨100 - lower thresholds increase processing load
- **ZK Proof Generation**: CPU-intensive, requires dedicated compute resources
- **Database Growth**: 4GB increments appropriate for telecom settlement volumes
- **Network Latency**: Cross-SP communication requires geo-distributed optimization

## üõ†Ô∏è PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT PIPELINE

### Required Build Process:
1. **Secure Build Environment**: Isolated, audited build infrastructure
2. **Reproducible Builds**: Deterministic compilation for security verification
3. **Multi-Stage Testing**: Unit ‚Üí Integration ‚Üí E2E ‚Üí Security ‚Üí Performance
4. **Container Security**: Base image scanning, dependency analysis
5. **Artifact Signing**: Cryptographic signatures on all deployment artifacts

### Deployment Verification:
- [ ] Binary checksum verification
- [ ] Container image signature validation
- [ ] Configuration drift detection
- [ ] Network connectivity testing
- [ ] ZK proof system validation
- [ ] Settlement calculation accuracy verification

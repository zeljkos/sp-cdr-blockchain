# SP CDR Blockchain Test Utilities

This directory contains utility tests for validating the production readiness of the SP CDR blockchain components.

## Available Tests

### `test_real_crypto.rs`
**Purpose**: Validates that the cryptographic key generation is truly random and production-ready.

**What it tests**:
- ‚úÖ Real cryptographically secure random key generation (using OS entropy)
- ‚úÖ Key uniqueness verification (no duplicate keys)
- ‚úÖ Performance benchmarking (keys/second generation rate)
- ‚úÖ Full cryptographic pipeline (key generation ‚Üí signing ‚Üí verification)

**Usage**:
```bash
# Run the comprehensive crypto test
cargo run --bin test-real-crypto
```

**Expected Output**:
```
üîê Testing Real Cryptographic Key Generation
============================================
Key 1: 7e576808...b27af258
Key 2: 7286695b...6ad67722
Key 3: c801b4e3...a80c9f7d
...
‚úÖ All keys are unique - cryptographically secure!
‚è±Ô∏è  Performance Test: Generated 100 keys in 0ms (3560746 keys/second)
‚úÖ Complete cryptographic pipeline is working!
üéØ Conclusion: SP CDR Blockchain cryptography is production-ready!
```

## Production Readiness

These tests verify that the blockchain uses **real cryptographic operations** suitable for production deployment:

- **Real Entropy**: Keys are generated using `getrandom::getrandom()` which sources entropy from the operating system
- **Security**: Each key is cryptographically unique and unpredictable
- **Performance**: Key generation is fast enough for production use
- **Integration**: Full sign/verify pipeline works correctly

## 3-VM Deployment Ready

All tests passing means the blockchain is ready for deployment across your 3-VM setup on the M4 Pro MacBook, with genuine production-grade security.
